function ind = find_boundary_4suDRBseq(tss_pos, exons_pos, chr_data, norm_param, bin_size)
% This function detect the boundary of a 4sUDRB-seq experiment, it gets as
% input the signal of the experiments for a DRB treated cells and of cells
% after a few minutes of DRB removal and return the predicted boundary
% Input variables:
% tss_pos - array of 4 integers
%   1.chromosome (index to the chr_data)
%   2.strand: 1 - positive 2 - negative
%   3.smaller edge of the transcript (index-wise not the 5' end)
%   4.larger edge of the transcript (index-wise not the 3' end)
% For example: [ 18           1     9102627     9134343]
% exons_pos - a cell array of arrays of exons positions
% For example: {[9102627 9102795],	[9117835 9117901],	[9119323 9119386]};
% chr_data - cell array with size (number of chromosomes) x 2
% in chr_data{c,i} we will have the binned data for chromosme index c for
% experiment i, where i = 1 is the zero (DRB treated experiment) and i = 2
% is data after DRB removal. The data for each chromosome is an array of
% the chromosome size divided by the bin size.
% norm_param - normalization parameter, this is due to having different
% amount of reads for the two experiments, so norm_param will be a two
% element array, in place i (1,2) it will have the sum of all signal in the
% chromosomes of chr_data for experiment i.
% bin_size - by which the chr_data was built
